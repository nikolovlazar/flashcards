# Flashcards 🧠

Flashcards is a simple CRUD app that allows users to create their own flashcards and categories, and lets them practice by showing them the cards. This project is part of a workshop we're doing at [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/welcome).

## Getting started

- `npm install`
- `cp .example.env .env`
- `npx prisma migrate reset`
- Create Sentry account
- Create Sentry project "flashcards"

## Finding Bugs

- Test out all the features of the Flashcards app
- When you encounter an error or notice a performance issue, go check Sentry
- It's more than likely your error has been picked up by Sentry
  - Click on the issue in your dashboard to see in depth details about where the issue happened, who it affected and what led to it.
